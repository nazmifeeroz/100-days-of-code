# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1 January 2018 (AngularJS)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed issues with the filters in my angularJS app.

**Thoughts:** I was told not to learn angularJS but for the sake of a job, I'm learning angularJS. plus it is version 1! but honestly angularJS is much more easier than reactJS. Today done all the CRUD functions in angularJS.
